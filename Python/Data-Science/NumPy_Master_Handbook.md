# NumPy Master Handbook
## Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Real-World Mastery

> **Purpose:** A single-file learning handbook for NumPy that can be used as a tutorial, reference, revision guide, interview-preparation resource, and practical cookbook.
>
> **Target:** Complete beginners as well as Python developers who want a strong numerical-computing foundation.
>
> **Documentation baseline:** NumPy 2.5-era APIs and practices.

# 1. What Is NumPy?

**NumPy** stands for **Numerical Python**.

It is the foundational Python library for efficient numerical computing. Its main object is the **N-dimensional array**, called `ndarray`.

NumPy is commonly used for:

- numerical calculations
- large arrays and matrices
- statistics
- linear algebra
- signal and image processing
- simulations
- machine learning preprocessing
- scientific computing
- financial calculations
- time-series manipulation
- data transformation
- geometry and engineering calculations

The conventional import is:

```python
import numpy as np
```

You will see `np` in almost every Python project using NumPy.

## First example

```python
import numpy as np

prices = np.array([100, 150, 200, 250])

discounted = prices * 0.90

print(discounted)
```

Output:

```text
[ 90. 135. 180. 225.]
```

`np.array()` converts the Python list into an `ndarray`. `prices` has shape `(4,)` and an integer dtype inferred from the input. Multiplication by the floating scalar `0.90` runs element by element and produces a new floating-point array, leaving `prices` unchanged. Instead of manually looping through each price in Python, NumPy performs the array operation in compiled numerical code.

---

# 2. Why NumPy Instead of Python Lists?

Python lists are excellent general-purpose containers.

NumPy arrays are specialized for numerical data.

## Python list

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## NumPy array

```python
numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

## Important differences

| Feature | Python List | NumPy Array |
|---|---|---|
| Mixed data types | Yes | Usually one dtype |
| Fast numeric operations | Limited | Excellent |
| Vectorized operations | No | Yes |
| Broadcasting | No | Yes |
| Multidimensional support | Nested lists | Native |
| Memory efficiency | Lower for large numeric data | Usually higher |
| Linear algebra | Manual/external | Built in |
| Scientific ecosystem | Limited | Core foundation |

## A common beginner surprise

Python:

```python
[1, 2, 3] * 2
```

gives:

```text
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

NumPy:

```python
np.array([1, 2, 3]) * 2
```

gives:

```text
[2 4 6]
```

That difference demonstrates the core idea of **vectorized numeric operations**.

---

# 3. Installation and Setup

Install NumPy:

```bash
python -m pip install numpy
```

Upgrade:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade numpy
```

Check the installed version:

```python
import numpy as np

print(np.__version__)
```

## Recommended project setup

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install:

```bash
python -m pip install numpy
```

## Quick environment test

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

print(a)
print(a.mean())
```

If this runs, your basic NumPy environment is ready.

Expected output is the array followed by its floating-point mean:

```text
[1 2 3]
2.0
```

NumPy 2.5 supports Python 3.12–3.14. If installation reports that no compatible distribution exists, check `python --version` and the Python-version requirements of the NumPy release you selected.

---

# 4. The ndarray Mental Model

The most important NumPy concept is:

```text
ndarray = data + shape + dtype + strides/metadata
```

An array is not just a list of values.

You should always ask:

1. What is the **shape**?
2. What is the **dtype**?
3. Which **axis** am I operating on?
4. Will this operation return a **view** or a **copy**?
5. Can broadcasting perform the operation without a Python loop?

## 1D array

```python
a = np.array([10, 20, 30])
```

Shape:

```text
(3,)
```

Think:

```text
3 elements
```

## 2D array

```python
a = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
])
```

Shape:

```text
(2, 3)
```

Think:

```text
2 rows
3 columns
```

## 3D array

```python
a = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))
```

Shape:

```text
(2, 3, 4)
```

A useful mental picture is:

```text
2 blocks
  each block has 3 rows
    each row has 4 values
```

## Dimensions

```text
scalar -> 0D
vector -> 1D
matrix -> 2D
tensor -> 3D+
```

NumPy itself uses the general term **array**, even when the data has many dimensions.

---

# 5. Creating Arrays

Array-creation functions differ mainly in where values come from and how shape, dtype, and initialization are chosen. Most accept a `dtype=` argument; functions that allocate by shape usually accept an integer for 1D or a tuple such as `(rows, columns)` for multiple dimensions.

## 5.1 From Python lists

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

2D:

```python
matrix = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
])
```

## 5.2 Explicit dtype

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float64)
```

## 5.3 zeros

```python
a = np.zeros(5)
```

2D:

```python
a = np.zeros((3, 4))
```

Use case: initialize an accumulator, image buffer, simulation state, or results matrix.

`np.zeros(shape, dtype=float)` returns a new zero-filled array. Floating-point is the default dtype, so `np.zeros(5)` displays decimal values. Pass `dtype=np.int64` when the result must store integer counts.

## 5.4 ones

```python
a = np.ones((2, 3))
```

Use case: initialize weights, masks, coefficients.

## 5.5 full

```python
a = np.full((3, 3), 7)
```

Use case: create an array with a default sentinel or constant.

## 5.6 empty

```python
a = np.empty((2, 3))
```

`empty()` allocates memory without initializing every value.

Do **not** assume it contains zeros.

Use it only when you will immediately overwrite all elements.

The values are whatever bit patterns happened to be in the allocated memory and are not predictable. Reading any element before assigning it is a correctness bug, not merely a display issue.

## 5.7 arange

```python
a = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
```

Result:

```text
[0 2 4 6 8]
```

Syntax:

```python
np.arange(start, stop, step)
```

`start` is inclusive, `stop` is exclusive, and `step` must not be zero. With one argument, that argument is `stop` and `start` defaults to zero. The output length is determined by the interval and step.

For floating-point ranges, `linspace()` is often easier to reason about.

## 5.8 linspace

```python
a = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
```

Result conceptually:

```text
[0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00]
```

`linspace(start, stop, num)` means:

> Give me exactly `num` evenly spaced samples.

The endpoint is included by default. Use `endpoint=False` when dividing a half-open interval, such as angular samples that should not repeat both 0 and 2π. With `retstep=True`, NumPy returns `(samples, spacing)` rather than only the samples.

Useful for plotting, simulations, interpolation, numerical analysis, and signal generation.

## 5.9 logspace

```python
a = np.logspace(0, 3, 4)
```

Produces values logarithmically spaced between powers.

With the default `base=10`, the example returns `[1., 10., 100., 1000.]` because the inputs `0` and `3` are exponents, not final values.

Useful for:

- logarithmic charts
- frequency ranges
- hyperparameter search
- engineering scale analysis

## 5.10 identity / eye

```python
identity = np.eye(3)
```

Result:

```text
[[1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1.]]
```

Use case: linear algebra.

## 5.11 diag

```python
a = np.diag([10, 20, 30])
```

Extract a diagonal:

```python
matrix = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
])

print(np.diag(matrix))
```

## 5.12 zeros_like / ones_like / full_like

```python
source = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

z = np.zeros_like(source)
o = np.ones_like(source)
f = np.full_like(source, 9)
```

These preserve shape and usually dtype.

That dtype preservation can surprise you. `np.full_like(source, 2.5)` truncates to integers when `source` has an integer dtype. Pass `dtype=float` when fractional values must be preserved.

## 5.13 From iterables

```python
a = np.fromiter(range(5), dtype=np.int64)
```

`fromiter(iterable, dtype, count=-1)` consumes a one-dimensional iterable and requires an explicit dtype. Supplying a correct `count` can let NumPy allocate once; an incorrect count can stop early or raise when the iterable is too short.

## 5.14 From buffers

Advanced applications can construct arrays using a raw memory buffer:

```python
data = b"\x01\x02\x03\x04"
a = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.uint8)
```

`frombuffer()` interprets existing bytes without copying when possible. The byte length must be compatible with the requested dtype, byte order matters for multi-byte values, and an array backed by immutable `bytes` is read-only. Copy the result if it must outlive or be independent of a mutable external buffer.

Useful in:

- binary protocols
- image/audio buffers
- networking
- file formats
- high-performance integration

---

# 6. Array Attributes

Create:

```python
a = np.array([
    [10, 20, 30],
    [40, 50, 60]
])
```

## shape

```python
a.shape
```

Result:

```text
(2, 3)
```

## ndim

```python
a.ndim
```

Result:

```text
2
```

## size

```python
a.size
```

Result:

```text
6
```

## dtype

```python
a.dtype
```

Represents the element data type.

## itemsize

```python
a.itemsize
```

Bytes used per element.

## nbytes

```python
a.nbytes
```

Approximate array data-buffer memory:

```text
size * itemsize
```

## T

Transpose view in common cases:

```python
a.T
```

## flags

```python
a.flags
```

Useful for diagnosing memory layout and contiguity.

Summary:

| Attribute | Type/meaning for the example |
| --- | --- |
| `shape` | `(2, 3)` — size of each axis |
| `ndim` | `2` — number of axes |
| `size` | `6` — total element count |
| `dtype` | Platform-inferred integer dtype |
| `itemsize` | Bytes used by one element |
| `nbytes` | `size * itemsize` for the data buffer only |
| `T` | Transposed array/view with shape `(3, 2)` |
| `flags` | Layout, ownership, alignment, and writeability metadata |

`nbytes` excludes Python object overhead and, for `dtype=object`, excludes the memory owned by referenced Python objects.

---

# 7. Data Types — dtype

NumPy arrays normally contain elements of a single data type.

Examples include:

```text
int8
int16
int32
int64

uint8
uint16
uint32
uint64

float16
float32
float64

complex64
complex128

bool
datetime64
timedelta64
string-related dtypes
structured dtypes
```

## Why dtype matters

Dtype controls:

- numerical range
- precision
- memory usage
- performance
- interoperability
- overflow behavior

## Example

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int32)

print(a.dtype)
```

## Convert dtype

```python
a = np.array([1.2, 2.9, 3.7])

b = a.astype(np.int32)

print(b)
```

Result:

```text
[1 2 3]
```

This is truncation, not normal mathematical rounding.

For rounding:

```python
rounded = np.rint(a).astype(np.int32)
```

## Memory comparison

```python
a = np.zeros(1_000_000, dtype=np.float64)
b = np.zeros(1_000_000, dtype=np.float32)

print(a.nbytes)
print(b.nbytes)
```

`float32` uses half the bytes of `float64`.

But lower precision may be unacceptable for certain calculations.

## Integer overflow

```python
a = np.array([127], dtype=np.int8)
a += 1

print(a)
```

Output:

```text
[-128]
```

An 8-bit signed integer represents only `-128` through `127`. Fixed-width integer arithmetic can wrap around instead of automatically becoming a larger Python integer. NumPy may not raise an exception for this operation, so choose and validate dtype range deliberately.

### Rule

Choose a dtype based on:

```text
required range
+ required precision
+ memory constraints
+ downstream library requirements
```

## Do not casually use object dtype

```python
np.array([1, "hello", object()], dtype=object)
```

An object array stores Python object references and usually loses much of NumPy's numerical performance advantage.

---

# 8. Indexing and Slicing

Each axis is zero-based: valid indices for an axis of length `n` run from `0` through `n - 1`, and negative indices count from the end. A scalar index removes that axis; a slice keeps it. For example, `matrix[1, :]` has shape `(3,)`, while `matrix[1:2, :]` keeps a two-dimensional shape `(1, 3)`.

## 8.1 1D indexing

```python
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

print(a[0])
print(a[-1])
```

## 8.2 Slicing

```python
print(a[1:3])
```

Python slicing rules apply:

```text
start inclusive
stop exclusive
```

## 8.3 Step

```python
a[::2]
```

## 8.4 Reverse

```python
a[::-1]
```

## 8.5 2D indexing

```python
matrix = np.array([
    [10, 20, 30],
    [40, 50, 60],
    [70, 80, 90]
])

print(matrix[1, 2])
```

Result:

```text
60
```

Equivalent but less idiomatic:

```python
matrix[1][2]
```

Prefer:

```python
matrix[1, 2]
```

## 8.6 Row selection

```python
matrix[1]
```

## 8.7 Column selection

```python
matrix[:, 1]
```

## 8.8 Submatrix

```python
matrix[0:2, 1:3]
```

## 8.9 Ellipsis

For high-dimensional data:

```python
tensor[..., 0]
```

`...` means:

> Fill in however many full dimensions are necessary.

Useful in image and ML tensors.

Example RGB image:

```python
red_channel = image[..., 0]
```

---

# 9. Boolean Indexing and Filtering

Boolean indexing is one of the most useful NumPy skills.

```python
scores = np.array([45, 89, 72, 30, 95])

mask = scores >= 60

print(mask)
print(scores[mask])
```

Short form:

```python
passed = scores[scores >= 60]
```

## Multiple conditions

Use `&`, `|`, and `~`.

```python
values = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20, 25])

result = values[(values >= 10) & (values <= 20)]
```

Do not write:

```python
values >= 10 and values <= 20
```

For arrays, use element-wise operators:

```text
&  AND
|  OR
~  NOT
```

Always parenthesize comparison expressions.

## Real-world example: suspicious invoice amounts

```python
invoice_amounts = np.array([500, 12000, 999999, 2500, -50])

suspicious = invoice_amounts[
    (invoice_amounts < 0) | (invoice_amounts > 100000)
]

print(suspicious)
```

---

# 10. Fancy / Advanced Indexing

Select elements using arrays/lists of indices.

```python
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

print(a[[0, 2, 4]])
```

Result:

```text
[10 30 50]
```

## Reordering

```python
a[[4, 0, 1]]
```

## 2D coordinate selection

```python
matrix = np.array([
    [10, 20, 30],
    [40, 50, 60],
    [70, 80, 90]
])

rows = np.array([0, 2])
cols = np.array([1, 0])

print(matrix[rows, cols])
```

Result selects:

```text
matrix[0,1] -> 20
matrix[2,0] -> 70
```

## np.ix_

Select combinations of row and column indices:

```python
rows = [0, 2]
cols = [0, 2]

sub = matrix[np.ix_(rows, cols)]
```

This produces the cross-product submatrix.

### Important

Basic slicing commonly creates **views**.

Advanced indexing generally creates **copies**.

Integer index arrays are broadcast together. `matrix[rows, cols]` pairs corresponding row and column indices and returns two scalar selections, while `matrix[np.ix_(rows, cols)]` constructs the Cartesian product and returns a 2D submatrix. Use the form that matches the intended output shape.

That distinction matters for both correctness and memory usage.

---

# 11. Changing Shape

## reshape

```python
a = np.arange(12)

matrix = a.reshape(3, 4)
```

Result:

```text
3 rows × 4 columns
```

The total number of elements must remain compatible.

`reshape()` returns an array with the requested shape. It returns a view when the existing memory layout permits and a copy otherwise, so do not depend on mutation sharing unless you verify it. It never changes the number of elements.

## Automatic dimension with -1

```python
a.reshape(2, -1)
```

NumPy calculates the missing dimension.

## flatten

```python
flat = matrix.flatten()
```

Returns a flattened **copy**.

## ravel

```python
flat = matrix.ravel()
```

Returns a flattened array and uses a view when possible.

## transpose

```python
matrix.T
```

Or:

```python
np.transpose(matrix)
```

For more dimensions:

```python
tensor = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))
reordered = tensor.transpose(2, 0, 1)

print(reordered.shape)
```

Output shape:

```text
(4, 2, 3)
```

## moveaxis

```python
np.moveaxis(tensor, 0, -1)
```

Very useful for image/tensor formats.

Example:

```text
channels-first: (C, H, W)
channels-last:  (H, W, C)
```

---

# 12. Adding and Removing Dimensions

## np.newaxis

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

column = a[:, np.newaxis]
row = a[np.newaxis, :]
```

Shapes:

```text
a       -> (3,)
column  -> (3, 1)
row     -> (1, 3)
```

This is extremely important for broadcasting.

## expand_dims

```python
np.expand_dims(a, axis=0)
```

`axis` is the position where the new length-1 dimension is inserted. For `a.shape == (3,)`, `axis=0` returns shape `(1, 3)` and `axis=1` returns `(3, 1)`.

## squeeze

Remove dimensions of size 1:

```python
a = np.zeros((1, 3, 1))

b = np.squeeze(a)

print(b.shape)
```

Result:

```text
(3,)
```

Use explicit axes when shape correctness is critical:

```python
np.squeeze(a, axis=0)
```

---

# 13. Joining and Splitting Arrays

Joining functions require compatible shapes and return new arrays. `axis` tells NumPy which existing dimension to extend; `stack()` is different because it creates a new dimension.

## concatenate

```python
a = np.array([1, 2])
b = np.array([3, 4])

np.concatenate([a, b])
```

`np.concatenate((arrays...), axis=0)` joins along an existing axis. All other axes must match. For two `(2, 3)` arrays, concatenating with `axis=0` gives `(4, 3)`; with `axis=1` it gives `(2, 6)`.

## stack

Adds a new axis:

```python
np.stack([a, b])
```

Both inputs must have the same shape. Two `(2,)` arrays stacked with the default `axis=0` produce `(2, 2)`; `axis=1` also produces `(2, 2)` but places the new axis in a different position and therefore arranges values differently.

Compare:

```text
concatenate: joins existing axes
stack:       creates a new axis
```

## vstack

```python
np.vstack([a, b])
```

## hstack

```python
np.hstack([a, b])
```

## column_stack

```python
names_as_codes = np.array([1, 2, 3])
scores = np.array([80, 90, 70])

table = np.column_stack([names_as_codes, scores])
```

## split

```python
a = np.arange(12)

parts = np.split(a, 3)
```

Requires equal division.

## array_split

```python
np.array_split(a, 5)
```

Allows unequal chunks.

## hsplit / vsplit

Useful for structured 2D splitting.

# 14. Copies vs Views

This is one of the most important NumPy topics.

A **view** shares the same underlying data buffer.

A **copy** owns independent data.

## View through slicing

```python
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

view = a[1:3]

view[0] = 999

print(a)
```

The original can change because the slice may share data.

## Explicit copy

```python
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

b = a[1:3].copy()

b[0] = 999

print(a)
```

The original stays unchanged.

## Check memory relationship

```python
np.shares_memory(a, view)
```

and:

```python
np.may_share_memory(a, view)
```

## Why this matters

Imagine:

```python
original_prices = np.array([100, 200, 300, 400])

working = original_prices[:2]

working *= 0
```

A beginner may expect only `working` to change.

But the original data can also be modified.

### Rule

If you intend to mutate data independently:

```python
working = original_prices[:2].copy()
```

---

# 15. Arithmetic and Element-Wise Operations

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([10, 20, 30])

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a ** 2)
print(b // a)
print(b % a)
```

These operations are normally **element-wise**.

The two arrays must have the same shape or broadcast-compatible shapes. For the example, the outputs are `[11, 22, 33]`, `[-9, -18, -27]`, `[10, 40, 90]`, floating quotients, `[1, 4, 9]`, integer floor quotients, and remainders. Division by zero and invalid floating operations normally produce `inf`/`nan` plus a runtime warning rather than a Python `ZeroDivisionError`; use `np.errstate()` when a deliberate numerical policy is required.

## Scalar operation

```python
prices = np.array([100, 200, 300])

taxed = prices * 1.18
```

No explicit loop is needed.

## In-place operation

```python
a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

a *= 2
```

Can reduce temporary allocations.

Be cautious with dtype:

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# a *= 1.5 may fail or require casting considerations
```

If fractional output is needed, create a floating array.

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=float)
a *= 1.5

# array([1.5, 3. , 4.5])
```

The integer form `a *= 1.5` raises a casting error because an in-place operation cannot safely put fractional results back into the existing integer buffer. The out-of-place expression `a * 1.5` can instead allocate a new floating array.

---

# 16. Universal Functions — ufuncs

A **ufunc** performs an element-wise operation over arrays and supports NumPy features such as broadcasting and dtype handling.

Examples:

```python
np.add(a, b)
np.subtract(a, b)
np.multiply(a, b)
np.divide(a, b)

np.sqrt(a)
np.exp(a)
np.log(a)
np.log10(a)

np.sin(a)
np.cos(a)
np.tan(a)

np.abs(a)
```

Operators often map to ufunc behavior:

```python
a + b
```

is conceptually related to:

```python
np.add(a, b)
```

Many ufuncs accept useful keyword arguments:

```python
out = np.zeros_like(a, dtype=float)
np.divide(a, b, out=out, where=b != 0)
```

`out=` stores results in an existing compatible array, reducing temporary allocation. `where=` controls which positions are calculated; positions where the mask is false retain their existing `out` value. Without an initialized `out`, skipped positions may be uninitialized.

## ufunc reduce

```python
np.add.reduce([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

Result:

```text
10
```

## accumulate

```python
np.add.accumulate([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

Result:

```text
[1, 3, 6, 10]
```

## outer

```python
np.multiply.outer([1, 2, 3], [10, 20])
```

Useful for constructing pairwise combinations.

## at

```python
a = np.zeros(5, dtype=int)

indices = [0, 1, 1, 3]

np.add.at(a, indices, 1)

print(a)
```

Useful when repeated indices must accumulate correctly.

Ordinary advanced-index assignment such as `a[indices] += 1` may buffer repeated selections and update an index only once. `np.add.at()` performs unbuffered accumulation, so index `1` receives two increments in this example and the output is `[1, 2, 0, 1, 0]`. This correctness guarantee can be slower than simpler operations when indices are unique.

---

# 17. Broadcasting

Broadcasting lets NumPy perform operations on arrays with different but compatible shapes.

## Simple scalar broadcasting

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

print(a * 10)
```

Conceptually, scalar `10` behaves as if it were:

```text
[10, 10, 10]
```

without necessarily allocating that full array.

## Matrix + row vector

```python
matrix = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
])

offset = np.array([10, 20, 30])

result = matrix + offset
```

Shape comparison:

```text
matrix: (2, 3)
offset:    (3,)
```

Align from the right:

```text
(2, 3)
(   3)
```

Compatible.

## Broadcasting rule

Compare dimensions from the right.

Two dimensions are compatible when:

```text
they are equal
OR
one of them is 1
```

Missing leading dimensions behave as `1`.

## Example that works

```text
(5, 4, 3)
(   1, 3)
```

Aligned:

```text
(5, 4, 3)
(1, 1, 3)
```

Compatible.

## Example that fails

```text
(2, 3)
(2,)
```

Compare final dimension:

```text
3 vs 2
```

Not compatible.

## Fix shape intentionally

```python
a = np.ones((2, 3))
b = np.array([10, 20])

b = b[:, None]

result = a + b
```

Shapes:

```text
a -> (2, 3)
b -> (2, 1)
```

Now broadcasting works.

## Real-world scenario: normalize each column

```python
X = np.array([
    [10., 100., 1000.],
    [20., 120., 1200.],
    [30., 140., 1400.]
])

mean = X.mean(axis=0)
std = X.std(axis=0)

X_scaled = (X - mean) / std
```

`mean` and `std` have shape `(3,)`, so they broadcast across rows.

If a column is constant, its standard deviation is zero and division produces invalid values. A deliberate preprocessing policy can preserve that column as zeros:

```python
safe_std = np.where(std == 0, 1.0, std)
X_scaled = (X - mean) / safe_std
```

## Key warning

Broadcasting is efficient when it avoids unnecessary data copies, but a mathematically large result can still require huge memory.

---

# 18. Aggregation and the Axis Concept

This is another core NumPy skill.

```python
a = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
])
```

## Sum everything

```python
a.sum()
```

Result:

```text
21
```

## Sum along axis 0

```python
a.sum(axis=0)
```

Result:

```text
[5, 7, 9]
```

You are reducing the **rows**, leaving one result per column.

A useful interpretation:

> `axis=0` collapses dimension 0.

## Sum along axis 1

```python
a.sum(axis=1)
```

Result:

```text
[6, 15]
```

You collapse columns and keep one result per row.

## keepdims

```python
a.mean(axis=1, keepdims=True)
```

Shape becomes:

```text
(2, 1)
```

instead of:

```text
(2,)
```

This is very useful for subsequent broadcasting.

An axis is removed by default. A tuple reduces several axes at once:

```python
batch = np.zeros((32, 224, 224, 3))
channel_mean = batch.mean(axis=(0, 1, 2))

# shape: (3,)
```

Most reductions also accept `dtype=`, which can control accumulator precision, and `where=`, which can select participating elements. Integer sums can overflow their accumulator dtype; floating means of an empty selection produce `nan` with a warning.

## Common aggregations

```python
np.sum(a)
np.mean(a)
np.median(a)
np.std(a)
np.var(a)
np.min(a)
np.max(a)
np.prod(a)
np.any(a)
np.all(a)
```

## Cumulative

```python
np.cumsum(a)
np.cumprod(a)
```

---

# 19. Min, Max, Argmin, Argmax and Related Operations

## Minimum value

```python
a.min()
```

## Maximum value

```python
a.max()
```

## Index of minimum

```python
a.argmin()
```

## Index of maximum

```python
a.argmax()
```

For multidimensional arrays:

```python
matrix.argmax(axis=1)
```

Without `axis`, `argmin()` and `argmax()` return the index in the flattened array. Use `np.unravel_index(matrix.argmax(), matrix.shape)` to convert that flat index into coordinates. With an axis, the result contains an index along that axis for each remaining position. Ties return the first occurrence in traversal order.

## Example: best monthly sales representative

```python
sales = np.array([
    [10, 12, 9],
    [8, 15, 11],
    [14, 13, 10]
])

best_rep_per_month = sales.argmax(axis=0)
```

## ptp

Peak-to-peak range:

```python
np.ptp(a)
```

Equivalent conceptually to:

```text
max - min
```

`ptp()` preserves the input dtype. On narrow signed integers, `max - min` can overflow and appear negative; cast to a wider dtype first when the full range matters.

---

# 20. Comparison and Logical Operations

```python
a = np.array([1, 5, 10, 15])

print(a > 5)
print(a == 10)
print(a != 1)
```

## logical_and

```python
np.logical_and(a >= 5, a <= 10)
```

## logical_or

```python
np.logical_or(a < 0, a > 100)
```

## logical_not

```python
np.logical_not(a > 5)
```

## any

```python
np.any(a > 10)
```

## all

```python
np.all(a > 0)
```

## Array equality

Do not rely on:

```python
a == b
```

if you need one final Boolean; it returns element-wise comparisons.

Use:

```python
np.array_equal(a, b)
```

`array_equal()` requires the same shape as well as equal elements. By default, NaNs are not equal; use `np.array_equal(a, b, equal_nan=True)` when matching NaN positions should count as equal.

For floating-point values:

```python
np.allclose(a, b)
```

because exact binary floating-point equality is often inappropriate.

`allclose()` tests values using relative and absolute tolerances. Defaults are convenient but not universally appropriate, especially for values near zero or domain-specific error budgets. Tests should normally pass explicit `rtol=` and `atol=` chosen for the calculation.

---

# 21. Conditional Selection

## np.where

```python
scores = np.array([45, 80, 30, 95])

labels = np.where(scores >= 60, "Pass", "Fail")
```

## Replace values conditionally

```python
amounts = np.array([-10, 100, 200, -5])

clean = np.where(amounts < 0, 0, amounts)
```

## select for multiple conditions

```python
scores = np.array([95, 82, 67, 40])

conditions = [
    scores >= 90,
    scores >= 75,
    scores >= 60,
]

choices = ["A", "B", "C"]

grades = np.select(conditions, choices, default="F")
```

Conditions are checked in order and the first true condition wins. That is why the most restrictive threshold (`>= 90`) appears first; reversing the list would label every score of 90 or more as `C` because it also satisfies `>= 60`.

## clip

When the condition is simply lower/upper bounds:

```python
values = np.array([-10, 20, 110])

bounded = np.clip(values, 0, 100)
```

Prefer `clip` over a complicated nested `where` for this scenario.

---

# 22. Sorting, Searching and Ranking

## sort

```python
a = np.array([30, 10, 20])

sorted_a = np.sort(a)
```

`np.sort()` returns a sorted copy.

Array method:

```python
a.sort()
```

sorts in place.

## argsort

Returns indices that would sort the array:

```python
a = np.array([30, 10, 20])

idx = np.argsort(a)

print(idx)
print(a[idx])
```

## descending sort

A version-compatible technique is:

```python
descending = np.sort(a)[::-1]
```

NumPy 2.5 adds an explicit option:

```python
descending = np.sort(a, descending=True)
```

Use the slicing form when the code must run on NumPy 2.4 or earlier. `np.sort()` sorts along the last axis by default and returns a copy; use `axis=None` to flatten first, and `stable=True` when equal items must preserve their original relative order.

## searchsorted

Useful when inserting/searching within a sorted array:

```python
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

pos = np.searchsorted(a, 25)
```

The result is index `2`, the insertion position that keeps the array sorted. The input must already be sorted according to the same ordering. `side="left"` returns the first suitable location for equal values and `side="right"` returns the position after existing equals.

## partition

If you only need the smallest/largest `k` values, full sorting can be unnecessary.

```python
a = np.array([9, 1, 7, 3, 8, 2])

smallest_three = np.partition(a, 3)[:3]
```

## argpartition

```python
idx = np.argpartition(a, 3)[:3]
```

Useful for:

- top-k recommendations
- nearest neighbors
- ranking large arrays
- percentile-like workflows

---

# 23. Unique Values and Set Operations

## unique

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])

values = np.unique(a)
```

Counts:

```python
values, counts = np.unique(a, return_counts=True)
```

## isin

```python
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

mask = np.isin(a, [20, 40])
```

## intersect1d

```python
np.intersect1d([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])
```

## union1d

```python
np.union1d([1, 2], [2, 3])
```

## setdiff1d

```python
np.setdiff1d([1, 2, 3], [2])
```

## setxor1d

Values present in either input, but not both.

---

# 24. Handling NaN and Infinity

NaN means:

```text
Not a Number
```

Create:

```python
x = np.nan
```

## NaN is unusual

```python
np.nan == np.nan
```

is false.

Use:

```python
np.isnan(x)
```

NaN is a floating-point missing/invalid marker. Ordinary integer and Boolean dtypes cannot represent it; adding `np.nan` to integer data normally requires conversion to a floating dtype or a separate mask.

## Detect infinity

```python
np.isinf(x)
```

## Detect finite numbers

```python
np.isfinite(x)
```

## NaN-aware functions

```python
np.nansum(a)
np.nanmean(a)
np.nanmedian(a)
np.nanmin(a)
np.nanmax(a)
np.nanstd(a)
```

These functions ignore NaN values, not infinity. An all-NaN slice still produces `nan` and usually a runtime warning. Silently ignoring missing values is a modeling decision, so also consider recording how many values participated.

## Example

```python
temperatures = np.array([31.2, np.nan, 29.8, 33.1])

average = np.nanmean(temperatures)
```

## Replace NaN and infinity

```python
clean = np.nan_to_num(
    a,
    nan=0.0,
    posinf=1e6,
    neginf=-1e6
)
```

### Important

Do not blindly replace missing values with zero.

Zero can have real business meaning.

Choose replacement based on the domain.

---

# 25. Rounding, Clipping and Numeric Utilities

## round

```python
np.round([1.2345, 9.8765], 2)
```

`np.round()`/`np.rint()` use tie-to-even behavior for exact halfway cases and operate on binary floating-point values, so some decimal-looking results can be surprising. They are not a substitute for decimal arithmetic or a legally defined financial rounding rule.

## floor

```python
np.floor([1.9, 2.1])
```

## ceil

```python
np.ceil([1.1, 2.9])
```

## trunc

```python
np.trunc([1.9, -1.9])
```

## clip

```python
np.clip(values, min_value, max_value)
```

## absolute value

```python
np.abs(a)
```

## sign

```python
np.sign([-5, 0, 7])
```

## close comparison

```python
np.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
```

## allclose

```python
np.allclose(array1, array2)
```

Use these instead of exact equality when comparing floating-point results.

For `isclose(a, b)`, the approximate rule is `abs(a - b) <= atol + rtol * abs(b)`, so the comparison is not perfectly symmetric in `a` and `b`. Choose the reference operand and tolerances intentionally in sensitive tests.

---

# 26. Random Number Generation

For modern NumPy code, use the `Generator` API:

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng()
```

For reproducible examples:

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
```

The seed creates a repeatable pseudorandom stream for simulations and tests. It does not make numbers cryptographically secure. Use Python's `secrets` module or an appropriate security API for tokens, passwords, and adversarial settings. For long-lived golden tests, pin the NumPy version and, when necessary, the bit generator rather than assuming every future default will emit the same sequence.

## Random floats

```python
rng.random(5)
```

## Random integers

```python
rng.integers(1, 7, size=10)
```

Simulates dice rolls from 1 through 6 because the upper bound is exclusive.

## Uniform

```python
rng.uniform(0, 100, size=5)
```

## Normal

```python
rng.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)
```

## Choice

```python
products = np.array(["A", "B", "C"])

sample = rng.choice(products, size=10)
```

Without replacement:

```python
rng.choice(products, size=2, replace=False)
```

With probabilities:

```python
rng.choice(
    ["A", "B", "C"],
    size=100,
    p=[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]
)
```

## Shuffle

```python
a = np.arange(10)

rng.shuffle(a)
```

Mutates the input.

## Permutation

```python
shuffled = rng.permutation(a)
```

Returns a permuted result.

## Common distributions

```python
rng.normal()
rng.uniform()
rng.binomial()
rng.poisson()
rng.exponential()
rng.gamma()
rng.beta()
```

## Simulation example: coin flips

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)

flips = rng.choice([0, 1], size=10000)

probability_heads = flips.mean()

print(probability_heads)
```

## Monte Carlo example: estimate π

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)

n = 1_000_000

x = rng.random(n)
y = rng.random(n)

inside = x*x + y*y <= 1

pi_estimate = 4 * inside.mean()

print(pi_estimate)
```

---

# 27. Statistics with NumPy

## Mean

```python
np.mean(a)
```

## Median

```python
np.median(a)
```

## Variance

```python
np.var(a)
```

## Standard deviation

```python
np.std(a)
```

The default `ddof=0` divides by `N`, which describes a population-style variance. A common sample estimate uses `ddof=1` and divides by `N - 1`:

```python
sample_std = np.std(a, ddof=1)
```

Whether `ddof=0` or `1` is correct depends on the statistical question, not on a universal preference.

## Percentile

```python
np.percentile(a, 90)
```

## Quantile

```python
np.quantile(a, 0.90)
```

## Correlation

```python
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 8])

corr = np.corrcoef(x, y)
```

For two 1D inputs, the result is a `2 × 2` correlation matrix; `corr[0, 1]` is their Pearson correlation. Correlation is undefined for a constant vector and does not imply causation.

## Covariance

```python
np.cov(x, y)
```

## Histogram

```python
values = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])

counts, edges = np.histogram(values, bins=3)
```

`counts` contains observations per bin and `edges` has length `len(counts) + 1`. All bins except the last are half-open; the final bin includes its right edge. Bin selection can materially change the visual/statistical story.

## Weighted average

```python
scores = np.array([80, 90, 70])
weights = np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.3])

weighted = np.average(scores, weights=weights)
```

## Real-world scenario: SLA timing

```python
response_minutes = np.array([
    10, 12, 15, 18, 25, 30, 45, 70, 120
])

print("mean:", response_minutes.mean())
print("median:", np.median(response_minutes))
print("p95:", np.percentile(response_minutes, 95))
```

Why use percentiles?

A mean can hide slow outliers. Operational systems often care about p90/p95/p99 behavior.

---

# 28. Linear Algebra

NumPy provides `np.linalg`.

```python
import numpy as np
```

## Vectors

```python
v = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
```

## Matrices

```python
A = np.array([
    [1.0, 2.0],
    [3.0, 4.0]
])
```

## Dot product

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

dot = np.dot(a, b)
```

Also:

```python
a @ b
```

for suitable vector/matrix operands.

## Matrix multiplication

```python
A @ B
```

or:

```python
np.matmul(A, B)
```

## Matrix transpose

```python
A.T
```

## Determinant

```python
np.linalg.det(A)
```

The determinant is a floating result and is not a reliable standalone test for singularity because rounding and scaling affect it. Use rank, condition information, or a failed solve according to the actual problem.

## Inverse

```python
np.linalg.inv(A)
```

But do not automatically use an inverse to solve equations.

## Solve linear equations

For:

```text
Ax = b
```

prefer:

```python
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
```

over:

```python
x = np.linalg.inv(A) @ b
```

`solve` is the clearer numerical operation and avoids explicitly constructing the inverse.

`A` must be square and full-rank, and the leading dimension of `b` must match. It returns the solution array and raises `np.linalg.LinAlgError` when the matrix is singular. For an overdetermined, underdetermined, or rank-deficient system, use `np.linalg.lstsq()` or a domain-appropriate SciPy solver.

## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

```python
values, vectors = np.linalg.eig(A)
```

For symmetric/Hermitian matrices, specialized functions such as `eigh` may be more appropriate.

## Matrix rank

```python
np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
```

## Norm

```python
np.linalg.norm(v)
```

## Least squares

```python
x, residuals, rank, singular_values = np.linalg.lstsq(A, b, rcond=None)
```

Useful when there is no exact solution or when fitting a linear model.

The returned `residuals` array can be empty—for example, when the system is not overdetermined or the effective rank is deficient—so do not assume `residuals[0]` always exists.

## SVD

```python
U, s, Vh = np.linalg.svd(A)
```

Uses include:

- dimensionality reduction concepts
- low-rank approximation
- recommendation systems
- image compression
- numerical stability analysis

## Condition number

```python
np.linalg.cond(A)
```

A very large condition number can indicate numerical sensitivity.

---

# 29. Matrix Multiplication in Depth

This is a frequent source of confusion.

Given:

```python
A.shape == (m, k)
B.shape == (k, n)
```

Then:

```python
A @ B
```

has shape:

```text
(m, n)
```

## Element-wise multiplication is different

```python
A * B
```

means element-wise multiplication, subject to broadcasting.

```python
A @ B
```

means matrix multiplication.

## Example

```python
A = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
])

B = np.array([
    [10, 20],
    [30, 40]
])

print(A * B)
print(A @ B)
```

These produce completely different results.

## Vector × matrix

```python
v = np.array([1, 2])
M = np.array([
    [10, 20, 30],
    [40, 50, 60]
])

result = v @ M
```

Shape:

```text
(3,)
```

## Matrix × vector

```python
M2 = np.array([
    [10, 20],
    [30, 40],
    [50, 60]
])

result = M2 @ v
```

Shape:

```text
(3,)
```

## Batch matrix multiplication

If arrays have higher dimensions, `matmul` / `@` can operate over stacks of matrices using broadcasting rules on leading dimensions.

This is important in:

- neural networks
- graphics
- scientific simulation
- batched transformations

# 30. Advanced Tensor Operations

## tensordot

```python
np.tensordot(a, b, axes=1)
```

Contracts selected axes.

`axes=1` sums the last axis of `a` with the first axis of `b`; their lengths must match. A pair such as `axes=([2, 0], [0, 1])` explicitly chooses several axes. The remaining, uncontracted axes determine the output shape.

## einsum

Einstein summation notation:

```python
np.einsum("ij,jk->ik", A, B)
```

This represents matrix multiplication.

Row sums:

```python
np.einsum("ij->i", A)
```

Element-wise dot:

```python
np.einsum("i,i->", a, b)
```

`einsum` can express complicated tensor operations compactly, but clarity should come before cleverness.

## outer product

```python
np.outer(a, b)
```

## inner product

```python
np.inner(a, b)
```

## cross product

```python
np.cross(a, b)
```

Useful in geometry and 3D graphics.

---

# 31. Coordinate Grids and meshgrid

Suppose you want to evaluate a function over a 2D surface.

```python
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 5)
y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 5)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

Z = X**2 + Y**2
```

Now `Z` contains the function value at each coordinate.

Use cases:

- contour plots
- surface plots
- physics
- image coordinate transformations
- geometry
- optimization visualization

## mgrid

Compact syntax:

```python
Y, X = np.mgrid[0:3, 0:4]
```

## indices

```python
rows, cols = np.indices((3, 4))
```

Useful for image and mask calculations.

---

# 32. Polynomial Operations

Modern NumPy provides polynomial APIs under:

```python
np.polynomial
```

Example:

```python
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

p = Polynomial([1, 2, 3])
```

Represents:

```text
1 + 2x + 3x²
```

Evaluate:

```python
p(2)
```

Roots:

```python
p.roots()
```

Derivative:

```python
p.deriv()
```

Integral:

```python
p.integ()
```

Fit:

```python
x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([1, 3, 7, 13])

fit = Polynomial.fit(x, y, deg=2)
```

Use cases:

- curve fitting
- calibration
- engineering models
- interpolation concepts

---

# 33. Fourier Transform Basics

NumPy includes FFT functionality under:

```python
np.fft
```

## FFT

```python
signal = np.array([0, 1, 0, -1])

spectrum = np.fft.fft(signal)
```

The result is complex: each bin stores frequency magnitude and phase information. For a signal sampled at interval `d` seconds, pair the transform with matching frequency bins:

```python
sample_interval = 0.01  # 100 Hz sampling rate
freq = np.fft.fftfreq(signal.size, d=sample_interval)
```

Without `d`, `fftfreq()` reports cycles per sample rather than hertz.

## Inverse FFT

```python
reconstructed = np.fft.ifft(spectrum)
```

For real input, the reconstructed result may contain tiny imaginary roundoff values. Use `np.real_if_close(reconstructed)` or compare with `np.allclose()` rather than truncating blindly.

## Frequencies

```python
freq = np.fft.fftfreq(len(signal))
```

## Real-input FFT

```python
spectrum = np.fft.rfft(signal)
```

Common uses:

- audio analysis
- frequency-domain filtering
- vibration analysis
- signal processing
- periodicity detection

### Important

NumPy gives the mathematical FFT tools.

For advanced scientific signal processing, SciPy provides a wider toolkit.

---

# 34. Date and Time Arrays

NumPy supports:

```text
datetime64
timedelta64
```

## Dates

```python
dates = np.array([
    "2026-01-01",
    "2026-01-02",
    "2026-01-03"
], dtype="datetime64[D]")
```

## Difference between dates

```python
delta = dates[2] - dates[0]
```

## Add days

```python
future = dates + np.timedelta64(7, "D")
```

## Units

Examples:

```text
Y
M
W
D
h
m
s
ms
us
ns
```

### Use carefully

Business calendars, time zones, holidays, and complex timestamp handling are often easier in pandas or specialized date/time libraries.

NumPy `datetime64` does not carry a time-zone object. Year (`Y`) and month (`M`) units are calendar-dependent rather than fixed durations, so converting them directly to days is not the same as converting hours to seconds. Use explicit units and an appropriate calendar-aware library when those distinctions matter.

---

# 35. Strings and Character Data

NumPy can store string-like data, but NumPy's greatest strength is numerical arrays.

Example:

```python
names = np.array(["alice", "bob", "charlie"])
```

String operations are available through NumPy's string functionality.

Examples conceptually include:

```python
np.strings.upper(names)
np.strings.lower(names)
```

depending on the exact dtype/API being used.

In NumPy 2.x, `np.strings` provides ufunc-style operations for fixed-width Unicode/bytes arrays and the newer variable-width `StringDType`. Fixed-width dtypes such as `<U5` can silently truncate longer values assigned later, so inspect `names.dtype` before treating a string array like a Python list of unrestricted strings.

## When to use

String arrays are useful when:

- data must remain inside a NumPy workflow
- fixed-size or specialized array representations are required
- structured scientific data contains text fields

For general tabular string processing, pandas or Python string methods may be more ergonomic.

---

# 36. Structured Arrays

A structured array can have named fields with different dtypes.

```python
people = np.array(
    [
        ("Alice", 25, 50000.0),
        ("Bob", 30, 65000.0),
    ],
    dtype=[
        ("name", "U20"),
        ("age", "i4"),
        ("salary", "f8")
    ]
)
```

Access a field:

```python
people["salary"]
```

Filter:

```python
people[people["age"] >= 30]
```

Useful for:

- binary file formats
- scientific record structures
- C-like records
- memory-mapped datasets

For general business tables, pandas DataFrames are usually more convenient.

---

# 37. Masked Arrays

Sometimes data is present but should be ignored.

```python
import numpy.ma as ma

data = np.array([10, 20, -999, 30])

masked = ma.masked_equal(data, -999)

print(masked.mean())
```

Use cases:

- sensor missing-value codes
- scientific grids
- geospatial data
- legacy datasets

This differs from simply replacing the bad value.

The original value remains but is masked from selected operations.

---

# 38. File Input and Output

## Save binary NumPy array

```python
a = np.arange(10)

np.save("data.npy", a)
```

Load:

```python
a = np.load("data.npy")
```

`.npy` preserves shape and dtype and is usually the best simple format for one NumPy array. `np.load()` defaults to `allow_pickle=False`; keep that safer default for untrusted files because loading pickled object arrays can execute arbitrary code when pickling is enabled.

## Save multiple arrays

```python
np.savez(
    "dataset.npz",
    features=X,
    labels=y
)
```

Load:

```python
with np.load("dataset.npz") as data:
    X = data["features"]
    y = data["labels"]
```

An `.npz` load returns a dictionary-like `NpzFile` backed by an open archive. The context manager closes its file descriptor after the arrays are read. `savez_compressed()` saves disk space at the cost of compression/decompression CPU time.

## Compressed archive

```python
np.savez_compressed("dataset.npz", features=X, labels=y)
```

## Text output

```python
np.savetxt("data.csv", a, delimiter=",")
```

## Text input

```python
a = np.loadtxt("data.csv", delimiter=",")
```

## Missing/irregular text input

```python
a = np.genfromtxt(
    "data.csv",
    delimiter=",",
    missing_values="",
    filling_values=np.nan
)
```

## Memory mapping

For arrays too large to load completely into RAM:

```python
m = np.memmap(
    "large.bin",
    dtype="float32",
    mode="r",
    shape=(10000, 1000)
)
```

`mode="r"` makes a read-only mapping. Shape, dtype, byte order, and file offset are external metadata for a raw binary file; supplying the wrong values can reinterpret bytes incorrectly without a friendly schema error. For a self-describing NumPy-format file, `np.load("large.npy", mmap_mode="r")` is often safer.

Use cases:

- large numerical datasets
- image/video chunks
- model embeddings
- scientific simulation outputs

---

# 39. Iteration

NumPy supports iteration:

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

for value in a:
    print(value)
```

2D:

```python
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

But avoid element-by-element Python loops when the same operation can be expressed using vectorized NumPy operations.

Bad:

```python
result = []

for x in a:
    result.append(x * 2)
```

Better:

```python
result = a * 2
```

## nditer

Advanced iteration:

```python
for x in np.nditer(matrix):
    print(x)
```

Useful for specialized array traversal and low-level behavior.

---

# 40. Memory Layout, Strides and Contiguity

NumPy stores array data in memory and uses metadata to interpret it.

Key concepts:

```text
shape
dtype
strides
C-contiguous layout
Fortran-contiguous layout
```

## Strides

```python
a = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)

print(a.strides)
```

Strides describe how many bytes must be moved in memory to step along each axis.

## C order

Typically row-major:

```python
np.array(data, order="C")
```

## Fortran order

Typically column-major:

```python
np.array(data, order="F")
```

## Contiguous conversion

```python
b = np.ascontiguousarray(a)
```

Useful when interoperating with:

- compiled C/C++
- OpenCV-like systems
- low-level libraries
- hardware/device interfaces

## Why transpose can be cheap

A transpose can often change only metadata such as strides instead of copying every value.

That is powerful but explains why a transposed array may no longer be contiguous in the original memory order.

---

# 41. Performance and Vectorization

NumPy is fastest when you operate on whole arrays using compiled array operations.

## Slow conceptual approach

```python
result = np.empty_like(a)

for i in range(len(a)):
    result[i] = a[i] * 2 + 1
```

## Vectorized

```python
result = a * 2 + 1
```

## Vectorization does NOT mean `np.vectorize`

A common misunderstanding:

```python
np.vectorize(my_python_function)
```

`np.vectorize` is primarily a convenience interface for applying Python functions. It is not automatically equivalent to a fast native NumPy ufunc.

For performance, prefer:

- built-in ufuncs
- broadcasting
- reductions
- matrix operations
- specialized NumPy functions
- NumPy-aware compiled libraries

## Avoid repeated append

Bad:

```python
a = np.array([])

for i in range(10000):
    a = np.append(a, i)
```

This repeatedly allocates new arrays.

Better:

```python
a = np.arange(10000)
```

Or collect in a Python list first:

```python
values = []

for item in source:
    values.append(process(item))

a = np.asarray(values)
```

## Preallocate

```python
result = np.empty(n)

for i in range(n):
    result[i] = expensive_external_operation(i)
```

If a Python loop is unavoidable, preallocating can reduce memory churn.

---

# 42. Memory Optimization

## Choose appropriate dtype

If values are always `0..255`:

```python
pixels = np.array(values, dtype=np.uint8)
```

instead of unnecessarily using `float64`.

## Avoid unnecessary copies

Potential copy:

```python
b = a.copy()
```

View when suitable:

```python
b = a[:]
```

But only use a view when shared-memory semantics are intended.

## In-place operations

```python
a *= 2
```

may allocate less temporary memory than:

```python
a = a * 2
```

## Beware chained temporaries

```python
result = (a * b) + (c * d)
```

This may allocate intermediate arrays.

For truly memory-sensitive pipelines, investigate `out=` where supported:

```python
temp = np.empty_like(a)

np.multiply(a, b, out=temp)
```

## Chunk huge workloads

Instead of processing a billion elements at once, process manageable blocks when the operation permits it.

---

# 43. Common Performance Anti-Patterns

## Anti-pattern 1: loops over every element

```python
for i in range(len(a)):
    a[i] = a[i] * 2
```

Use:

```python
a *= 2
```

## Anti-pattern 2: repeated np.append

Use preallocation or build a list first.

## Anti-pattern 3: object dtype for numerical data

```python
np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=object)
```

Avoid unless Python-object storage is genuinely needed.

## Anti-pattern 4: giant broadcasted result

```python
A[:, None, :] - B[None, :, :]
```

This can create an enormous pairwise tensor.

Sometimes chunking or a specialized algorithm is better.

## Anti-pattern 5: unnecessary copy before every operation

Understand views and mutation.

## Anti-pattern 6: using inverse to solve equations

Prefer:

```python
np.linalg.solve(A, b)
```

## Anti-pattern 7: premature micro-optimization

First:

1. write correct vectorized code
2. measure
3. locate the bottleneck
4. optimize the actual bottleneck

---

# 44. Interoperability with Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib

NumPy is a foundation for much of the scientific Python ecosystem.

## Pandas

Convert:

```python
arr = df.to_numpy()
```

or:

```python
arr = series.to_numpy()
```

A pandas DataFrame offers labels, mixed column types, joins, grouping, missing-value semantics, etc.

Use NumPy when array math is the main problem.

Use pandas when table semantics are the main problem.

## Matplotlib

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 1000)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

## SciPy

SciPy builds on NumPy and offers specialized scientific functionality such as:

- optimization
- integration
- signal processing
- sparse matrices
- scientific statistics
- advanced linear algebra
- spatial algorithms

## Machine learning

Libraries such as scikit-learn commonly accept NumPy-like arrays.

Typical shape:

```text
X -> (number_of_samples, number_of_features)
y -> (number_of_samples,)
```

Understanding NumPy shape semantics directly improves ML debugging skills.

---

# 45. Typing, Validation and Testing

NumPy provides typing helpers.

```python
import numpy as np
import numpy.typing as npt

def normalize(
    x: npt.ArrayLike
) -> npt.NDArray[np.float64]:
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float64)

    if x.size == 0:
        raise ValueError("x must not be empty")
    if not np.isfinite(x).all():
        raise ValueError("x must contain only finite values")

    std = x.std()
    if std == 0:
        raise ValueError("x must not be constant")

    return (x - x.mean()) / std
```

`ArrayLike` accepts common inputs such as lists and arrays; `NDArray[np.float64]` communicates the return dtype to a static type checker. These hints do not validate runtime inputs or express a fixed shape. `np.asarray()` converts the input and avoids a copy when an existing array already satisfies the requested dtype/layout. The explicit checks define behavior for empty, non-finite, and constant input before calculating the result.

## Assert shape

```python
assert X.ndim == 2
assert X.shape[1] == 10
```

Assertions are useful for internal invariants and tests, but Python can remove them when run with optimization (`python -O`). Use explicit `if ...: raise ValueError(...)` checks at public/API boundaries where validation must always run.

## Assert finite values

```python
assert np.all(np.isfinite(X))
```

## Test exact arrays

```python
np.testing.assert_array_equal(actual, expected)
```

## Test floating arrays

```python
np.testing.assert_allclose(actual, expected)
```

Testing numerical code should explicitly consider:

- floating tolerance
- NaN behavior
- dtype
- shape
- edge cases
- empty arrays
- large values
- negative values
- reproducibility

---

# 46. NumPy 2.x Awareness and Migration Tips

NumPy 2.x introduced significant API and compatibility changes compared with older tutorials.

This handbook targets NumPy 2.5, released in June 2026. NumPy 2.5 supports Python 3.12–3.14, removes `numpy.distutils`, expires many earlier deprecations, and adds features such as `descending=` for sort APIs. Use release notes for the exact version deployed by your project.

When maintaining old code:

## 1. Avoid deprecated aliases

Old examples may contain obsolete aliases such as:

```python
np.int
np.float
np.bool
np.complex
```

Use explicit Python or NumPy types appropriate to the job, for example:

```python
int
float
bool

np.int64
np.float64
```

## 2. Do not assume old binary extensions work

Compiled packages built against incompatible NumPy versions can produce import or ABI errors.

When upgrading NumPy in a scientific environment, also verify compatible versions of packages that compile against NumPy.

## 3. Prefer current random Generator API

New code:

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
rng.normal(size=100)
```

rather than relying on the legacy global random state.

## 4. Check migration notes before large upgrades

Especially for:

- dtype behavior
- removed/deprecated APIs
- binary extensions
- C API
- type promotion
- string handling
- old third-party packages

## 5. Pin dependencies for production

Example:

```text
numpy>=2.5,<2.6
```

Only choose a version range after testing your project.

---

# 47. Common Errors and Troubleshooting

## Error: operands could not be broadcast together

Example:

```text
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together
```

Check:

```python
print(a.shape)
print(b.shape)
```

Align shapes from the right.

Fix with reshape/newaxis where mathematically appropriate.

## Error: too many indices

You indexed an array as if it had more dimensions than it actually does.

Check:

```python
print(a.ndim)
print(a.shape)
```

## Error: index out of bounds

```python
a[10]
```

when the axis does not contain that index.

Check:

```python
a.shape
```

## Error: cannot reshape array

Example:

```python
np.arange(10).reshape(3, 4)
```

Impossible because:

```text
10 != 3 × 4
```

## Unexpected mutation

Usually a view/copy issue.

Use:

```python
np.shares_memory(a, b)
```

and make an explicit copy where needed.

## Unexpected integer result

Check dtype:

```python
print(a.dtype)
```

Use floating dtype when the calculation requires decimals.

## NaN spreads through calculations

Example:

```python
np.mean([1, np.nan, 3])
```

Use a NaN-aware strategy such as:

```python
np.nanmean(...)
```

if ignoring missing values is appropriate.

## Ambiguous truth value

This fails:

```python
if a > 5:
    ...
```

because `a > 5` may contain many booleans.

Use:

```python
if np.any(a > 5):
    ...
```

or:

```python
if np.all(a > 5):
    ...
```

depending on meaning.

For an empty array, `np.any(empty)` is `False` and `np.all(empty)` is `True` (vacuous truth). Decide whether empty input is valid before using either result as a business decision.

## Import errors after upgrade

Check versions:

```bash
python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
```

Reinstall or upgrade the incompatible package, or use a compatible NumPy version according to that package's requirements.

# 48. Real-World Scenario Cookbook

This section combines multiple NumPy concepts.

---

## Scenario 1 — Invoice Amount Validation

Requirement:

- amount must be positive
- amount must not exceed ₹1,000,000
- flag suspicious entries

```python
import numpy as np

amounts = np.array([
    5000,
    25000,
    -100,
    1500000,
    76000
], dtype=float)

valid_mask = (amounts > 0) & (amounts <= 1_000_000)

valid = amounts[valid_mask]
invalid = amounts[~valid_mask]

print("Valid:", valid)
print("Invalid:", invalid)
```

Concepts used:

```text
array creation
boolean masks
comparison
filtering
```

---

## Scenario 2 — GST Calculation

```python
base_amount = np.array([1000, 2500, 5000], dtype=float)
gst_rate = 0.18

gst = base_amount * gst_rate
final_amount = base_amount + gst

print(final_amount)
```

Concept:

```text
scalar broadcasting
```

Different tax rates:

```python
rates = np.array([0.05, 0.12, 0.18])

final = base_amount * (1 + rates)
```

Concept:

```text
element-wise operation
```

---

## Scenario 3 — Monthly Sales Dashboard

Rows = products.

Columns = months.

```python
sales = np.array([
    [100, 120, 130, 150],
    [80, 90, 110, 140],
    [200, 210, 205, 220]
])

product_totals = sales.sum(axis=1)
monthly_totals = sales.sum(axis=0)
best_product = product_totals.argmax()

print(product_totals)
print(monthly_totals)
print(best_product)
```

Concepts:

```text
2D arrays
axis
sum
argmax
```

---

## Scenario 4 — Feature Standardization for ML

```python
X = np.array([
    [10., 100., 1000.],
    [20., 120., 1100.],
    [30., 140., 1300.],
    [40., 160., 1500.]
])

mean = X.mean(axis=0)
std = X.std(axis=0)

safe_std = np.where(std == 0, 1, std)

X_scaled = (X - mean) / safe_std
```

Concepts:

```text
aggregation
axis
broadcasting
conditional selection
```

---

## Scenario 5 — Image Brightness

An image can be represented as:

```text
(height, width, channels)
```

Example:

```python
image = np.array(
    [
        [[100, 120, 140], [200, 210, 220]],
        [[50, 60, 70], [240, 250, 255]]
    ],
    dtype=np.uint8
)
```

To brighten safely:

```python
bright = image.astype(np.int16) + 30
bright = np.clip(bright, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)
```

Why convert first?

Because direct arithmetic on a small unsigned integer dtype can overflow or wrap depending on the operation.

Concepts:

```text
dtype
casting
clipping
image tensor
```

---

## Scenario 6 — Remove Sensor Outliers

```python
readings = np.array([
    20.1, 20.4, 20.3, 99.0, 20.5, 20.2
])

median = np.median(readings)

deviation = np.abs(readings - median)

clean = readings[deviation < 5]

print(clean)
```

For a more formal statistical rule, use domain-appropriate methods instead of hard-coded thresholds.

---

## Scenario 7 — Attendance Analysis

```python
hours = np.array([
    [9.0, 8.5, 7.0, 9.5, 8.0],
    [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 7.5, 8.5],
    [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.5]
])

weekly_hours = hours.sum(axis=1)

under_target = weekly_hours < 40

print(weekly_hours)
print(under_target)
```

Find each employee's lowest day:

```python
lowest_day = hours.argmin(axis=1)
```

---

## Scenario 8 — Portfolio Return Simulation

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)

expected_daily_return = 0.0005
daily_volatility = 0.01

simulated_returns = rng.normal(
    loc=expected_daily_return,
    scale=daily_volatility,
    size=(10_000, 252)
)

annual_return = np.prod(1 + simulated_returns, axis=1) - 1

print(np.mean(annual_return))
print(np.percentile(annual_return, [5, 50, 95]))
```

Educational simulation only; real financial modeling requires more assumptions and risk analysis.

## Scenario 9 — Pairwise Distances

Points:

```python
points = np.array([
    [0., 0.],
    [3., 4.],
    [6., 8.]
])
```

Broadcast:

```python
diff = points[:, None, :] - points[None, :, :]
distances = np.sqrt(np.sum(diff**2, axis=-1))
```

Result is a distance matrix.

Concepts:

```text
newaxis
broadcasting
reduction
Euclidean distance
```

Warning: for huge datasets, the full pairwise matrix may consume enormous memory.

---

## Scenario 10 — One-Hot Encoding

```python
labels = np.array([0, 2, 1, 2])

num_classes = 3

one_hot = np.eye(num_classes)[labels]

print(one_hot)
```

Advanced indexing selects one identity-matrix row per label, producing shape `(len(labels), num_classes)`. Validate that labels are integers in `0 <= label < num_classes`; negative indices select from the end and out-of-range positive indices raise `IndexError`.

Concepts:

```text
identity matrix
advanced indexing
ML preprocessing
```

---

## Scenario 11 — Normalize Each Row

```python
X = np.array([
    [3., 4.],
    [5., 12.]
])

norms = np.linalg.norm(X, axis=1, keepdims=True)

normalized = X / norms
```

`keepdims=True` preserves shape `(n, 1)` so broadcasting is natural.

If zero rows are allowed, avoid division by zero:

```python
normalized = np.divide(
    X,
    norms,
    out=np.zeros_like(X),
    where=norms != 0,
)
```

---

## Scenario 12 — Confusion Matrix Without a Loop

```python
actual = np.array([0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2])
pred = np.array([0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1])

num_classes = 3

cm = np.zeros((num_classes, num_classes), dtype=int)

np.add.at(cm, (actual, pred), 1)

print(cm)
```

---

## Scenario 13 — Rolling Window View

A simple window representation can be built using:

```python
from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import sliding_window_view

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

windows = sliding_window_view(a, window_shape=3)

print(windows)
```

Conceptually:

```text
[1 2 3]
[2 3 4]
[3 4 5]
```

Rolling mean:

```python
rolling_mean = windows.mean(axis=1)
```

Use stride tricks carefully because views can have non-obvious memory semantics.

---

## Scenario 14 — Group Counts with bincount

If category IDs are non-negative integers:

```python
category_ids = np.array([0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0])

counts = np.bincount(category_ids)
```

`bincount()` requires a one-dimensional array of non-negative integers. Its output length is one more than the largest ID unless `minlength=` requests a longer result, so sparse huge IDs can allocate a huge array. Use `np.unique(..., return_counts=True)` or a table/grouping library when IDs are sparse or not integers.

Weighted aggregation:

```python
amounts = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])

totals = np.bincount(category_ids, weights=amounts)
```

This can be extremely useful for fast grouped integer-category aggregation.

---

## Scenario 15 — Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

```python
celsius = np.array([-10, 0, 10, 20, 30])

fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32
```

A perfect beginner example of vectorization.

# 51. Interview Questions

## Beginner

### What is NumPy?

A Python numerical-computing library centered around the N-dimensional `ndarray`.

### What is an ndarray?

A homogeneous N-dimensional array with associated metadata such as shape, dtype and strides.

### What is shape?

A tuple describing the size of each dimension.

### What is ndim?

The number of dimensions.

### What is dtype?

The type used to represent array elements.

### What is vectorization?

Expressing operations over entire arrays rather than manually iterating element by element in Python.

### What is broadcasting?

Rules that allow operations between arrays with compatible but different shapes.

### Difference between Python list and ndarray?

NumPy arrays are specialized for efficient numerical operations, typically have a homogeneous dtype, support broadcasting and multidimensional vectorized operations.

---

## Intermediate

### Difference between reshape and resize?

`reshape` returns an array with a new shape when compatible and typically does not conceptually mean “change how many elements exist.”

`resize` APIs can have different semantics and may change storage/size. Read the exact API before using it.

### Difference between ravel and flatten?

`flatten()` returns a copy.

`ravel()` returns a flattened view when possible.

### Difference between view and copy?

A view shares the underlying data buffer.

A copy owns independent data.

### Difference between `*` and `@`?

`*` is element-wise multiplication.

`@` performs matrix multiplication.

### Why is `keepdims=True` useful?

It retains reduced axes with size 1, often making later broadcasting straightforward.

### `np.array` vs `np.asarray`?

Both create/obtain arrays.

`asarray` is often used when you want an ndarray-like representation while avoiding an unnecessary copy when possible.

### Why use `np.allclose`?

Floating-point calculations can produce tiny representation differences, so tolerance-based comparison is often more meaningful than exact equality.

---

## Advanced

### What are strides?

Byte steps required to move along each axis in an array.

### Why can slicing be cheap?

Basic slicing often returns a view sharing the existing data buffer.

### Why can transposing be cheap?

NumPy can often modify shape/stride metadata instead of physically rearranging every value.

### Why can broadcasting be memory efficient?

It can conceptually expand dimensions without materializing repeated copies of the smaller array.

### When can broadcasting still be expensive?

When the output itself is extremely large, or when later operations force materialization of a huge intermediate.

### Why can object dtype be slow?

Operations may involve Python objects and Python-level dispatch rather than compact native numeric storage.

### Why prefer `np.linalg.solve(A, b)` over `inv(A) @ b`?

It expresses the mathematical intent directly and avoids explicitly constructing the inverse.

### Is `np.vectorize` a performance optimization?

Usually no. It is mainly a convenience wrapper around a Python function.

### Basic vs advanced indexing?

Basic slicing typically produces views.

Advanced/fancy indexing typically produces copies.

### What is C-contiguous vs F-contiguous?

They are common memory layout conventions describing how multidimensional elements are laid out in the underlying contiguous buffer.

# Appendix A — Shape Reasoning Drills

Shape reasoning is one of the fastest ways to become good at NumPy.

Given:

```python
A = np.zeros((10, 5))
b = np.zeros((5,))
```

What is:

```python
(A + b).shape
```

Answer:

```text
(10, 5)
```

---

Given:

```python
A = np.zeros((10, 5))
b = np.zeros((10,))
```

Will this work?

```python
A + b
```

No.

Alignment:

```text
(10, 5)
(   10)
```

Final dimensions `5` and `10` conflict.

Fix if the intent is one value per row:

```python
A + b[:, None]
```

Now:

```text
(10, 5)
(10, 1)
```

---

Given:

```python
X = np.zeros((32, 224, 224, 3))
bias = np.zeros((3,))
```

Then:

```python
X + bias
```

works because the 3-element array broadcasts over the channel dimension.

This pattern appears constantly in image processing and machine learning.

---

# Appendix B — Axis Reasoning Drills

Given:

```python
X.shape == (100, 20)
```

Interpret:

```text
100 samples
20 features
```

Then:

```python
X.mean(axis=0)
```

shape:

```text
(20,)
```

One mean per feature.

And:

```python
X.mean(axis=1)
```

shape:

```text
(100,)
```

One mean per sample.

---

Given image batch:

```text
(batch, height, width, channels)
(32, 224, 224, 3)
```

Mean color for each image:

```python
image_mean = X.mean(axis=(1, 2))
```

Shape:

```text
(32, 3)
```

Mean across the whole batch and all pixels:

```python
channel_mean = X.mean(axis=(0, 1, 2))
```

Shape:

```text
(3,)
```

---

# Appendix C — Dtype Selection Guide

A simplified decision guide:

## Integers

Use integer dtype when values are exact counts/IDs and no decimals are needed.

Examples:

```text
quantity
category ID
pixel channel
count
index
```

## float32

Useful when:

- memory is important
- ML libraries expect it
- precision is sufficient

## float64

Useful when:

- higher numerical precision is desired
- scientific/financial computations demand more headroom
- it is the natural NumPy default for many floating operations

## uint8

Useful for compact `0..255` image channel values.

## bool

Useful for masks:

```python
mask = values > threshold
```

## datetime64 / timedelta64

Useful for regular numerical date/time arrays.

## object

Use only when you actually need arbitrary Python objects.

---

# Appendix D — NumPy vs Pandas vs SciPy vs Python

## Use NumPy when

- data is predominantly numerical
- shape and tensor operations matter
- performance depends on vectorized numerical operations
- you need linear algebra
- you need simulations
- you need a common numerical representation

## Use pandas when

- data is tabular
- column names and row labels matter
- mixed column types matter
- joins/grouping/table cleaning dominate the task

## Use SciPy when

- advanced scientific algorithms are needed
- optimization, sparse methods, signal processing, integration, etc. are required

## Use plain Python when

- data is small
- logic is irregular
- objects are heterogeneous
- readability matters more than vectorized numeric throughput

---

# Appendix E — Debugging Template

When a NumPy expression fails, print:

```python
print("type:", type(x))
print("shape:", x.shape)
print("ndim:", x.ndim)
print("dtype:", x.dtype)
print("size:", x.size)
```

For two arrays:

```python
print("A:", A.shape, A.dtype)
print("B:", B.shape, B.dtype)
```

Then ask:

```text
1. Are the dimensions what I think they are?
2. Are the dtypes what I think they are?
3. Which axis am I reducing?
4. Will broadcasting succeed?
5. Is a view being mutated?
6. Are NaN/inf values present?
7. Am I using element-wise multiplication when I need matrix multiplication?
8. Is the result too large for memory?
```

This checklist resolves a large percentage of everyday NumPy bugs.

---

# Appendix F — Clean NumPy Coding Guidelines

Prefer:

```python
prices_with_tax = prices * (1 + tax_rate)
```

over vague names:

```python
x2 = x * y
```

Keep shape assumptions visible:

```python
# X shape: (samples, features)
feature_mean = X.mean(axis=0)
```

Validate external data:

```python
X = np.asarray(X, dtype=np.float64)

if X.ndim != 2:
    raise ValueError("X must be a 2D array")
```

Use deterministic random seeds in tests:

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
```

Do not mutate shared views unintentionally.

Prefer readable vectorization over highly compressed tricks.

Comment **why**, especially when axis choices are non-obvious.

# Appendix H — The Five Questions to Ask Before Writing NumPy Code

Before solving a problem, answer:

```text
1. What shape should the input have?
2. What shape should the output have?
3. What dtype is appropriate?
4. Which axis represents which real-world meaning?
5. Can the operation be expressed using vectorization/broadcasting?
```

If you can answer these five questions, implementation becomes dramatically easier.

# Final Perspective

NumPy mastery is not about memorizing every function in the library.

It is about developing a reliable mental model:

```text
DATA
  ↓
ndarray
  ↓
shape + dtype
  ↓
index/slice/filter
  ↓
reshape/align axes
  ↓
broadcast
  ↓
vectorized ufunc
  ↓
aggregate / linear algebra / transform
  ↓
validate shape + dtype + numerical behavior
```

The most important topics to revisit until they feel natural are:

```text
1. ndarray
2. shape
3. axis
4. dtype
5. indexing
6. broadcasting
7. vectorization
8. views vs copies
9. aggregation
10. linear algebra
```

Once these become second nature, the rest of NumPy becomes much easier to learn from the official API reference as needed.
